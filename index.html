          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>   This semester, I explored design thinking principles and practices in-depth, 
            which completely changed my opinion of design. Initially, my understanding of 
            design thinking was limited, although I did have experience in designing websites 
            and a couple of products I created from scratch. The course provided me with a 
            structured understanding of essential elements such as empathy in design, iterative 
            prototyping, and collaborative ideation.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-7" data-aos="fade-left">
            <h2>User-Centered Research</h2>
            <p>One of the most meaningful aspects of my learning was recognizing how user-centered
               research can transform the design process. Recently, I have been watching a series
                of videos by Sam Altman and his team at Y Combinator at Stanford University, where
                 they discuss what it takes to be a successful startup.</p>
                 <h2></h2>
            <p> A prominent point discussed
              is improving your product through customer feedback. This realization resonated
               with me as it emphasized designing with the user in mind, leading to more effective
                and impactful solutions.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              This course has also taught me several important concepts, methods, and mindsets related to design thinking. Firstly, I learned the significance of empathy in design, which involves understanding and prioritizing the needs and emotions of users to create more user-centered solutions. Secondly, the practice of iterative prototyping was emphasized, highlighting the importance of creating multiple prototypes and continually refining them based on user feedback and testing. Finally, the course underscored the value of collaborative ideation, where diverse perspectives and teamwork are leveraged to generate innovative ideas and solutions through brainstorming and group collaboration.</p>

        <h2>Aha Moments</h2>
        <p>Two "aha moments" stood out during the course: first, when we learned to use Figma and Canva to create quick design prototypes, and second, understanding the concept of "fail early, fail often," which redefined failure as a crucial part of the learning and design process. This specifically connected with me as I feel I learn most when I am at the edge of my ability, making many mistakes but being able to learn and see why something didn't work.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-7" data-aos="fade-left">
            <h2>Project Experience</h2>
            <p>A high point in my learning journey was successfully developing a prototype to update the LORIS website based on user feedback and ideas our group implemented. However, coordinating group efforts and managing time effectively proved challenging.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In future endeavours, I plan to apply these design thinking principles by incorporating user feedback early and often and embracing an iterative approach to problem-solving. I am particularly interested in further exploring rapid prototyping and user testing methods for some future businesses that I wish to test out and start. This will give me the ability to quickly test out an idea and bring it to market in the fastest way possible so I don't make the same mistake as I did in the past which was spending too much time on an idea without knowing if it would work or was wanted.</p>

            <h2>Reflection on Contributions</h2>
            <p>Reflecting on my contributions to the LORIS redesign project, I believe I had a significant impact on its success. My roles included conducting user research, developing survey questions, creating the initial prototype, and being a part of the final presentation and pitch.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> This experience not only deepened my understanding of design thinking but also demonstrated the practical application of these principles in a real-world context and inspired me to want to take another shot in business.</p>
